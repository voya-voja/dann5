# dann5

This project aims to simplify the programming of quantum computing models and shows how to faster develop interactive examples that will help you learn to formulate and solve problems for the D-Wave system using [Dann5 d5o library](https://github.com/voya-voja/dann5). The d5o library is an extension of D-Wave Ocean's stack of tools, which will allow you to develop integrated code, and to submit it to run in a quantum annealing computer (QAC), either D-Wave Advantage, 2000Q or Hybrid Solver.

The goal of Dann5 project and d5o framework is to provide QAC developers with programming constructs, such as:
- standard types:
    - **Qbit**† – quantum bit, where
      > Qbit x ϵ { 0, 1, S(uperposition) }
    - **Qbool**† – quantum boolean, where
      > Qbool x ϵ { T(rue), F(alse), S(uperposition) }
    - **Qbin**† – quantum binary, as an array of Qbit’s
      > Qbin x ≡ Qbit[ xi; where xi ϵ Qbit & 0 <= i <= n ]
    - **Qwhole** – quantum whole numbers (non-negative integer), where 
      > 	Qwhole x ∈ { n | n ≥ 0                                         }
      >                {   | n = U(nknown) if ni = S | ni ϵ Qbit & ni ϵ n} }
    - **Qnnr**†† – quantum non-negative rational numbers, where 
      > 	Qnnr x ∈ { r | r ∈ R(ational) & n≥0                          }
      >              {   | r = U(nknown) if ri = S | ri ϵ Qbit & ri ϵ r} }
- definitions:
  - **Qvar** - quantum variable
    > Qvar a(3, “a”) ⇛ initialize Q variable a with 3 quantum bits in S(uperpostion) state
    
    > Qvar b(“b”, 6) ⇛ initialize Q variable b with value 6, i.e. b0 = 0, b1 = 1 and b2 = 1
    
    > Qvar c(“c”, 2.5) ⇛ initialize Q variable c with binary value 10.1, i.e. c-1 = 1, c0 = 0 and c1 = 1 ††
    
    > Qvar a(1.2, “d”) ⇛ initialize Q variable d with 3 quantum bits, as an unknown rational number, i.e. d-2 = S, d-1 = S and d0 = S ††
    
  - **Qequation** - quantum equation statement
    > Qequation eX(Qvar(“X”, 15)) ⇛ creates a Q equation eX with result Q variable defined as A and set to 15
    
    > eX = a * b ⇛ for Q variables a and b (defined above) assigns multiplication expression to eX Q equation
    
  - **Qcondition**† - quantum condition statement
    > Qcondition cA(a > b) ⇛ creates a Q condition cA that compares (above defined) Q variables a and b
    
    > cA << eX ⇛ adds the (above defined) eX Q equation to be calculated under condition cA, i.e. a is bigger than b
    
  - **Qroutine**† - quantum routine
    > Qroutine program(“my Q program”) ⇛ creates a Q routine program, which allows correlation of programming Q statements
    
    >	program << cA << eB ⇛ adds the (above defined) cA Q condition and a predefined eB Q equation into my Q program
    
  - **Qfunction**† - quantum function routine
    >	Qfunction myF(“my F”, a) ⇛ creates a Q function routine my F with Q variable a as a return variable
    
    >	myF << cA << a + b ⇛ adds the (above defined) cA Q condition and addition Q equation of a and b into myF
    
    >	eB *= myF ⇛ updates eB Q equation with a multiplication of its existing expression with a return from myF Q function
    
   - **Qpow**, **Qmod**†, **Qgcd**† - specialized quantum function
      >	Qpow a_x3(a, 3) ⇛ creates a power Q function routine a_x3 with Q variable a as a base and exponent 3
   
      >	Qmod b_m3(b, 3) ⇛ creates a modulo Q function routine b_m3 with Q variable b as a dividend and divisor 3
   
      >	Qgcd a_b(a, b) ⇛ creates a greatest common divisor Q function routine a_b for Q variables a and b
- standard operations:
  - **assignment**  – of quantum variable or expression to the Q equation
  - **unary operators**: ~ (inversion)
  - **binary operators**: +, *, -, /
  - **logical operators**: &, |, ^, nand, nor
  - **comparison operators**: ==, !=, >, >=, <, <=
- D-Wave Ocean integration:
  - **qubo()**  – returns Qubo binary quadratic model (BQM)
    > eX.qubo() ⇛ for eX Q equation (defined above) returns a Qubo dictionary object for execution on an exact or QAC solver
  - **samples()**  – receives a dictionary of samples returned by a solver 
    > eX.samples(lowSamples) ⇛ sets resulting samples returned from a solver into eX Q equation, which has been used to create Qubo BQM
  - **solutions()**  – receives a dictionary of samples returned by a solver 
    > eX.solutions() ⇛ for eX Q equation (defined above) with expected result 15 and b set to 6 returns solutions for undefined Q variable a

  2.	Build 
    -	d5o.cp38-win_amd64.pyd for windows and python x64

  > a = Qvar(4, "a")
  
  > b = Qvar(3, "b")
